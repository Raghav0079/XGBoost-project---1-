# XGBoost-project---1-
This repository contains a small example project that demonstrates using XGBoost for a supervised machine learning task inside a Jupyter notebook (`code.ipynb`). The notebook walks through data loading, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training with XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
## Contents
- `code.ipynb` — main notebook with the end-to-end workflow (data prep, training, evaluation, and visualization).
## Project overview
The goal of this project is to provide a concise, reproducible example of training an XGBoost model on tabular data. The notebook is organized into these sections:
- Problem definition and dataset description
- Data loading and basic cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (plots and statistics)
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Model training with XGBoost (sklearn API)
- Hyperparameter tuning (optional grid / randomized search)
- Model evaluation and interpretation (metrics, feature importance)
## Getting started
These instructions show how to set up a local environment and run the notebook on Windows (PowerShell). The steps use Python 3.8+.
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
2. Install required packages. If you don't have a `requirements.txt` in this repo, install the common dependencies used by the notebook:
```powershell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterlab notebook pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
```
3. Start Jupyter and open `code.ipynb`:
```powershell
jupyter notebook
```
Then open the `code.ipynb` file in your browser and run the cells interactively.
## Data
This repository does not include a dataset. The notebook expects you to provide a CSV file or adapt the loading cell to fetch data from a different source. Typical places you might add data:
- Create a `data/` directory and add `train.csv` / `test.csv` files.
- Modify the notebook to download a public dataset (e.g., UCI, Kaggle) at runtime.
If you want a quick test without external files, edit the notebook to use a synthetic dataset (for example, `sklearn.datasets.make_classification`).
## Expected outputs and evaluation
The notebook includes standard classification/regression metrics depending on the task (accuracy, precision/recall, ROC AUC for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression). It also demonstrates plotting feature importances and partial dependence (if desired).
## Notes and assumptions
- This project uses the XGBoost sklearn-compatible API (XGBClassifier / XGBRegressor).
- The notebook is intended for educational/demo use. For production training consider additional concerns (data validation, reproducible seeds, logging, checkpointing, and model serialization).
## Optional improvements (next steps)
- Add a `requirements.txt` with pinned package versions.
- Add example data in a `data/` folder and update the notebook to load it.
- Add a small script to run training from the command line (e.g., `train.py`) and unit tests for preprocessing logic.

If you'd like, I can: add a `requirements.txt`, include a small synthetic-data example inside the notebook, or create a `train.py` script to run the model from the command line. Tell me which of those you'd like next.
